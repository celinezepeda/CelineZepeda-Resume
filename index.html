        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Celine Zepeda. I am an 18 year old that attends University of Riverside, California. I do have past experience in both volunteering and the work field. I have done an internship at Kaiser Hospital in 2019 working in the Pediatric Center. There I worked alongside nurses in two different floors assisting any needs. The Pico Rivera Healthcare center is another one of the locations that I have volunteered at working with the elderly. There I helped by playing games, having conversations, and keeping the elderly entertained. I have also volunteered at my Catholic church called St. Romero. We hosted several events to fundraise money for the church and do community bonding. My first job was at a gym called Eastvale Athletics. There I worked with children in the daycare center area. Working at the front desk filling out contracts, giving gym tours, and helping maintain a clean gym was some of the other tasks of that job. Starbucks was my second job. As a barista, I memorized how to make hundreds of drinks, worked register, and did drive through too. With these opportunities, I have been able to grow my communications skills, critical thinking, teamwork skills,  problem solving, and organization skills. I take the initiative to do better at everything I do. Helping others is a priority of mine and I will always go above and beyond for my employer. Some of my internet activities outside of work include any outdoor activities. The beach and going on hikes are my absolute favorites. Similarly, I absolutely love traveling. The process of seeing a new part of the world while learning about a new community is very enjoyable to me. Working out is a very big passion of mine. Growing up I played soccer for 8 years and started Crossfit as a freshman in High School. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is extremely valuable to me as it fuels me with the energy to get my day started off just right. I value my big family as we are all very close. I have an older brother and two younger sisters. We are all very close in age only two years apart, so that brings us all closer. Having a good relationship with my family is very important to me since I have always been extremely family oriented and they truly are my support system. I am a proud owner of three dogs. Their names are taco, buzz, and chimi. Taking them on walks and playing fetch is their favorite activity. My goal in any aspect of life is to always seek change and do better. I know that with time, dedication, and the right motives, I can excel in any tasks given. Improvement is always what drives me in doing better. My life consists of healthy healthy habits and doing the best at my craft.
